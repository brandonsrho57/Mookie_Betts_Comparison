## Plot 1

![Joint Bar Graph of Mookie Betts's Hitting Statistics](Mookie.png)

**Description:** 
The following joint bar graph was based on Mookie Betts's (a baseball player) performance between 2017 as a Red Sox player
and 2020 as a Dodgers player. This shows that Mookie Betts is hitting much better as a Dodger than he did as part of the 
Red Sox in 2017, despite playing during the pandemic. It's a tribute to how good Mookie is as a player, and how he's always 
in the MVP discussion.
